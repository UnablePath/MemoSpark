Document specific complexities, rendering artifacts, and scaling problems. \n2. **SVG Redesign/Simplification:** Based on the analysis, either redesign a new, simpler SVG for the mascot or drastically simplify the existing one using an SVG editor. Prioritize clean paths, a proper `viewBox` for intrinsic scaling, and removal of any elements that hinder performance or scalability, while retaining the mascot's core identity. Optimize the SVG for web usage. \n3. **Component Re-implementation (from scratch):** Create a new `KoalaMascot.tsx` (or overwrite with a completely new implementation). It must be a React functional component using TypeScript. \n4. **Props & Styling:** The component should primarily use Tailwind CSS classes passed via the `className` prop for sizing (e.g., `w-16 h-16`, `w-24 h-24`) to ensure consistency with the project's styling conventions and enable responsive design. If absolutely necessary for dynamic sizing not achievable with Tailwind, a `size` prop (numeric or predefined strings like 'sm', 'md', 'lg') could be considered, but Tailwind utility classes are preferred. Ensure SVG parts use `currentColor` for fills/strokes where appropriate to inherit text color, or use CSS variables if needed. **Avoid inline styles.** \n5. **Performance & Accessibility:** Ensure the SVG is optimized and the component is performant. Include appropriate ARIA attributes (`role='img'`, `aria-labelledby` referencing a `<title>` element within the SVG). \n6. **Integration & Verification:** Replace all existing usages of the old mascot component (e.g., in `GamifiedReminderTab.tsx`, `StuTaskGuidance.tsx`, `StuPreferences.tsx`) with the new one. **Rigorously test** in all contexts to confirm correct display, crisp scaling at various sizes/resolutions, absence of rendering artifacts, and no negative performance impact. **Verify that this from-the-ground-up rework resolves previous sizing and display complaints comprehensively.**",

Create indexes on `user_id` for both tables and potentially on `due_date` for `tasks`. \n4. **RLS Policies:** For both tables, implement RLS policies: Enable RLS. Create policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` ensuring users can only operate on their own data (`user_id = auth.uid()`). **No shortcuts on RLS; security is paramount.** \n5. **Apply Migrations:** Use the Supabase CLI (or VS Code extension if integrated) to apply the migration (`supabase db push` or `supabase migration up`). **Verify successful application using Supabase MCP if possible, or Studio.** \n6. **Triggers for `updated_at`:** Implement database triggers to automatically update the `updated_at` column on any row update for both tables.",
