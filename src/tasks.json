Prioritize clean paths, a proper `viewBox` for intrinsic scaling, and removal of any elements that hinder performance or scalability, while retaining the mascot's core identity. Optimize the SVG for web usage. \n3. **Component Re-implementation (from scratch):** Create a new `KoalaMascot.tsx` (or overwrite with a completely new implementation). It must be a React functional component using TypeScript. \n4. **Props & Styling:** The component should primarily use Tailwind CSS classes passed via the `className` prop for sizing (e.g., `w-16 h-16`, `w-24 h-24`) to ensure consistency with the project's styling conventions and enable responsive design. If absolutely necessary for dynamic sizing not achievable with Tailwind, a `size` prop (numeric or predefined strings like \"sm\", \"md\", \"lg\") could be considered, but Tailwind utility classes are preferred. Ensure SVG parts use `currentColor` for fills/strokes where appropriate to inherit text color, or use CSS variables if needed. **Avoid inline styles.** \n5. **Performance & Accessibility:** Ensure the SVG is optimized and the component is performant. Include appropriate ARIA attributes (`role='img'`, `aria-labelledby` referencing a `<title>` element within the SVG). \n6. **Integration & Verification:** Replace all existing usages of the old mascot component (e.g., in `GamifiedReminderTab.tsx`, `StuTaskGuidance.tsx`, `StuPreferences.tsx`) with the new one. **Rigorously test** in all contexts to confirm correct display, crisp scaling at various sizes/resolutions, absence of rendering artifacts, and no negative performance impact. **Verify that this from-the-ground-up rework resolves previous sizing and display complaints comprehensively.**",

Create indexes on `user_id` for both tables and potentially on `due_date` for `tasks`. \n4. **RLS Policies:** For both tables, implement RLS policies: Enable RLS. Create policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` ensuring users can only operate on their own data (`user_id = auth.uid()`). **No shortcuts on RLS; security is paramount.** \n5. **Apply Migrations:** Use the Supabase CLI (or VS Code extension if integrated) to apply the migration (`supabase db push` or `supabase migration up`). **Verify successful application using Supabase MCP if possible, or Studio.** \n6. **Triggers for `updated_at`:** Implement database triggers to automatically update the `updated_at` column on any row update for both tables.",

Use `rrule.js` to generate instances within the view's date range. Each instance should inherit properties from the master task but have its specific `dueDate`.

When a user gives feedback, store it here. This may require a new migration and RLS. **Use Supabase MCP tools to manage this.** \n4. **Leverage Feedback in AI Logic:** Modify the AI suggestion generation logic (this might be in `StudySparkAI.generateIntelligentSuggestions` or its calling functions) to consider this feedback. For example, if a user frequently dislikes a certain type of suggestion, deprioritize it. This might involve sending feedback summaries to the AI model if it's an LLM, or adjusting client-side ranking algorithms. \n5. **Diversity & Caching:** Review the existing suggestion caching mechanism in `AITaskSuggestions.tsx`. If the cache key is too broad or lifetime too long, it might contribute to repetition. Consider making the cache more granular or adding mechanisms to introduce variety even with cached elements (e.g., rotating through a set of valid suggestions for a similar context). \n6. **Fallback Suggestions:** Ensure fallback suggestions (if AI fails) are also context-aware and varied.",
