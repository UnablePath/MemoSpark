      "summary": "Successfully optimized the StudentConnectionTab component by:\n\n1. **Breaking down the monolithic 684-line component** into smaller, maintainable components:\n   - Extracted `StudentCard` component (136 lines)\n   - Extracted `ChatModal` component (144 lines) \n   - Created reusable `GridView` and `SwipeView` components\n   - Main component reduced from 684 to ~350 lines\n\n2. **Implemented proper loading states and error handling**:\n   - Added `LoadingSpinner` component with accessible loading indicators\n   - Created `ErrorDisplay` component with retry functionality\n   - Added try/catch blocks around all critical operations\n   - Implemented graceful error recovery for localStorage, confetti, and API operations\n\n3. **Performance optimizations**:\n   - Used React.memo() for expensive components\n   - Implemented lazy loading for heavy components (StudentCard, ChatModal)\n   - Added useMemo() for filtered students computation\n   - Created custom hooks for better state management\n   - Added Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks\n\n4. **Improved architecture**:\n   - Created shared TypeScript types in `/types/student.ts`\n   - Extracted custom hooks to `/hooks/useStudentConnection.ts`\n   - Proper separation of concerns and single responsibility principle\n   - Better error boundaries and loading states\n\nThe page now loads successfully without errors, displays proper loading states during data fetch, and handles error conditions gracefully.
