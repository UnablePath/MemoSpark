Implement spring animation for smooth preview transitions\\n4. Add threshold for committing to full tab switch\\n5. Ensure proper cleanup of preview states",
      "verificationCriteria": "Users can preview tabs with partial swipes, smooth animations during preview, proper threshold for full tab switch.",
      "analysisResult": "Emergency bug fixes for StudySpark app launch promotion tomorrow. All fixes must maintain existing functionality, pass TypeScript compilation, work with current database schema, and be thoroughly tested. Priority on simple solutions that work with existing system architecture without introducing breaking changes.",
      "summary": "Successfully implemented half-swipe tab preview functionality with smooth animations and proper threshold logic. Added previewState tracking, calculatePreviewProgress helper function, enhanced onSwiping handler to show partial tab content during swipes, implemented 25% progress threshold for committing to tab switches, created preview animation variants with proper z-indexing and transformations, and included proper cleanup and state management. Users can now preview tab contents before fully committing to a tab switch, creating a more intuitive navigation experience. TypeScript compilation passes successfully.",
