Priority order: notifications → database persistence → auth backend → AI optimization. Architecture follows existing patterns with TypeScript strict typing, component composition, and offline-first approach.",
      "summary": "Successfully implemented comprehensive browser notification system with permission management, scheduled reminders, and integration with existing RemindersTab component. Created notification service singleton, custom React hook, and UI controls. Features include notification types (task_due, study_reminder, break_reminder, achievement), quiet hours, daily limits, permission handling, and seamless integration with AI preferences. All components follow established patterns with TypeScript strict typing and proper error handling. Build verification confirms successful compilation with no errors.",
