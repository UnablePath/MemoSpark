- Study group creation
- Advanced achievements and leaderboards
- Calendar integration
- Push notifications
- Voice input
- Accessibility features beyond basic responsive design
- Advanced analytics
- **Advanced tutorial features (adaptive personality, video tutorials, mini-games)**

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Tutorial System Implementation**
**Libraries & Tools:**
- **Shepherd.js** for guided tour functionality with custom Stu integration
- **Framer Motion** for Stu animations and smooth transitions
- **React Context** for tutorial state management
- **localStorage** for tutorial progress tracking

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// Tutorial system architecture
const TutorialProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [tutorialStep, setTutorialStep] = useState(0);
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  const [stuAnimation, setStuAnimation] = useState('idle');
  
  // Tutorial step management and Stu animation coordination
};
```

### **AI/ML Approach for MVP**
Given the tight timeline, implement a **simplified rule-based system** that appears "smart":

```javascript
// Simplified AI approach
const suggestTasks = (userHistory) => {
  // Rule-based logic that seems intelligent
  const patterns = analyzeSimplePatterns(userHistory);
  return generateSuggestions(patterns);
};
```

### **Tech Stack Decisions**
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript (already set up)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (already configured)
- **Storage**: localStorage for MVP (easy to migrate to Supabase later)
- **Physics**: matter.js for ragdoll game
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and Stu animations
- **Tutorial**: Shepherd.js + custom Stu integration

### **Development Strategy**
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Progressive enhancement** (works on basic devices)
- **Local-first approach** (no complex backend needed for MVP)
- **Component-driven development** for reusability
- **Tutorial-first development** (ensure all features work with tutorial overlay)

## Daily Standup Structure

### **Daily Check-ins (15 minutes max)**
- **What did you complete yesterday?**
- **What are you working on today?**
- **Any blockers or dependencies?**
- **Quick integration points needed?**
- **Tutorial integration status?**

### **Integration Meetings**
- **Day 3**: Feature integration checkpoint + tutorial flow review
- **Day 6**: Mid-week integration and testing + tutorial user testing
- **Day 9**: Final integration and bug fixes + tutorial polish

## Success Criteria for MVP

### **Technical Success**
- ✅ App loads and navigates smoothly on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Users can create accounts and complete onboarding
- **✅ 95%+ of users complete the tutorial successfully**
- ✅ Tasks can be created, viewed, and completed
- ✅ AI provides at least 3 relevant suggestions per day
- ✅ Users can connect with other students and send messages
- ✅ Ragdoll game is playable and satisfying
- ✅ Stu mascot responds to user actions
- **✅ Tutorial takes less than 8 minutes to complete**

### **User Experience Success**
- **✅ Tutorial completion rate > 95%**
- ✅ Core user journey (add task → get AI suggestion → complete task) works smoothly
- ✅ App feels responsive and polished
- ✅ Stress relief features provide satisfying experience
- **✅ Users understand all core features after tutorial**
- **✅ Positive feedback on Stu's guidance and personality**

## Risk Mitigation

### **High-Risk Areas**
1. **AI Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity post-launch
2. **Feature Scope Creep**: Strictly enforce P0 only
3. **Integration Complexity**: Daily integration checkpoints
4. **Performance**: Focus on core experience, optimize later
5. **Tutorial Length**: Keep under 8 minutes, make skippable

### **Backup Plans**
- **AI fails**: Fall back to basic reminders and manual scheduling
- **Social features complex**: Simplify to basic profiles only
- **Ragdoll game issues**: Replace with simpler stress-relief activity
- **Authentication problems**: Use simple local accounts initially
- **Tutorial too complex**: Fall back to simple text-based onboarding
- **Stu animations lag**: Use simpler CSS animations instead of complex SVG

## Post-MVP Immediate Roadmap (Week 3-4)

### **Priority Enhancements**
1. **Tutorial analytics and optimization based on user behavior**
2. **Advanced Stu personality features and adaptive responses**
3. Real-time messaging improvements
4. Enhanced AI pattern learning
5. Advanced achievements system
6. Performance optimizations
7. User feedback collection system

### **Tutorial System Enhancements**
- **Video tutorial library with Stu demonstrations**
- **Contextual help system that learns when users struggle**
- **Advanced tutorial customization based on user learning style**
- **Mini-games during tutorial for engagement**

This plan prioritizes getting a **functional, engaging app** with an **exceptional onboarding experience** in users' hands quickly, while setting up the foundation for rapid iteration and improvement based on real user feedback.
