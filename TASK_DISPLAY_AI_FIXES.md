# Task Display and AI Authentication Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Tasks Not Being Displayed (Major Issue)

**Problem**: Tasks were being successfully created in the database but not appearing in the UI dashboard. The dashboard showed "No tasks yet" despite successful task creation.

**Root Cause**: The `TaskEventHub` component was using a local Zustand store (`useTaskStore`) instead of the proper database query hooks that connect to Supabase.

**Solution Applied**:
- **Replaced** `useTaskStore` with proper database hooks:
  - `useFetchTasks` for fetching tasks from database
  - `useDeleteTask` for deleting tasks  
  - `useCreateTask` for creating tasks
- **Added** proper Clerk authentication token passing using `getToken({ template: 'supabase-integration' })`
- **Added** loading states and error handling to the ListView
- **Updated** all task operations to use authenticated database mutations instead of local store

**Key Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
const { tasks, addTask, updateTask, deleteTask } = useTaskStore();

// After (working):
const { getToken } = useAuth();
const getTokenForSupabase = useCallback(() => 
  getToken({ template: 'supabase-integration' }), [getToken]
);
const { data: tasks = [], isLoading, error, refetch } = useFetchTasks(undefined, getTokenForSupabase);
const deleteTaskMutation = useDeleteTask(getTokenForSupabase);
const createTaskMutation = useCreateTask(getTokenForSupabase);
```

### 2. AI Suggestions 403 Forbidden Errors (Major Issue)

**Problem**: All AI suggestion requests were returning 403 Forbidden errors, preventing the Hugging Face AI functionality from working.

**Root Cause**: Authentication mismatch between client and server:
- **Client**: Sending JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header
- **Server**: Using Clerk's `auth()` function which expects authentication via cookies, not Authorization header

**Solution Applied**:
- **Removed** manual Authorization header from all AI API calls
- **Let Clerk handle authentication automatically** through cookies/session
- **Updated** `useTieredAI` hook to not manually pass tokens
- **Simplified** authentication flow to use Clerk's built-in mechanisms

**Key Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before (causing 403):
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
}

// After (working):
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  // Clerk handles auth via cookies automatically
}
```

### 3. Added Better User Experience

**Improvements Made**:
- **Loading States**: Added spinner and loading message while tasks are being fetched
- **Error Handling**: Added error display with retry button if task fetching fails
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript types for better development experience
- **Authentication Flow**: Streamlined token passing for Supabase integration

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

✅ **Tasks Display**: 
- Tasks created through TaskForm will immediately appear in the List View
- Loading spinner shows while fetching tasks
- Error states with retry functionality

✅ **AI Suggestions**:
- AI suggestion requests should return 200 instead of 403
- Hugging Face AI functionality should work properly
- Tier-based AI features should be accessible

✅ **Better Performance**:
- Real database queries instead of local store
- Proper caching through React Query
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
```
User Action → TaskEventHub → useAuth() → getToken() → Supabase API → Database
                      ↓
            CalendarViewEnhanced → getTokenForSupabase → Authenticated Queries
```

### Database Integration
- All task operations now use authenticated Supabase client
- RLS policies properly enforced with Clerk JWT tokens
- Real-time updates through React Query cache invalidation

### Files Modified
- `src/components/tasks/TaskEventHub.tsx` - Major refactor to use database hooks
- `src/hooks/useTieredAI.ts` - Fixed authentication for AI requests
- Added proper loading states and error handling throughout

## Testing
To verify fixes are working:
1. **Create a task** - Should appear immediately in List View
2. **Switch between views** - Tasks should persist across Calendar/List views  
3. **Click AI Suggestions** - Should not get 403 errors
4. **Network tab** - AI requests should return 200/success responses

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any remaining authentication issues
- Test AI suggestions thoroughly
- Verify task CRUD operations work correctly
- Check for any performance improvements needed
