I have analyzed the "Unable to authenticate this browser for your development instance" error, and it indicates a mismatch between your Clerk configuration and your deployment environment. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it.

### The Problem: Development Keys in a Production Environment

The error message on `memospark.live` is happening because your application is using **Clerk's development keys**, but it's being accessed from a non-development URL.

- **Clerk Development Instances** are designed for local development (e.g., `localhost:3000`) and will not work on your production domain.
- **Clerk Production Instances** are required for your live site (`memospark.live`).

The most likely cause is that the environment variables on your hosting platform (like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.) for the `memospark.live` deployment are set to your development keys instead of your production keys.

### How to Fix It

You will need to update the environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard. Here are the steps:

1.  **Get Your Production Keys from Clerk:**
    *   Log in to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
    *   Navigate to the correct project for `memospark.live`.
    *   Go to **API Keys** and make sure you are viewing the **Production** keys.
    *   Copy the **Publishable key** and the **Secret key**. The publishable key starts with `pk_live_...` and the secret key starts with `sk_live_...`.

2.  **Update Environment Variables on Your Hosting Provider:**
    *   Log in to your hosting provider's dashboard (e.g., Vercel).
    *   Navigate to your project's settings.
    *   Find the **Environment Variables** section.
    *   Update the following variables with the production keys you copied from Clerk:
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Paste the **Production Publishable Key**.
        *   `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Paste the **Production Secret Key**.

3.  **Redeploy Your Application:**
    *   After updating the variables, trigger a new deployment of your `main` branch to ensure the changes take effect.

Once the new deployment is live, the authentication error on `memospark.live` should be resolved.
