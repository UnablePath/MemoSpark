# StudySpark AI Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for StudySpark's 4-tier AI system, covering data privacy protection, behavioral data encryption, mood detection privacy safeguards, social learning anonymization, and production security measures.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Data Privacy Protection Framework

#### Behavioral Data Encryption
- **Encryption Method**: AES-256-GCM with unique per-user keys
- **Key Management**: Derived from user credentials using PBKDF2
- **Storage**: Encrypted behavioral patterns stored with salt and auth tags
- **Access Control**: Tier-based access to encrypted data

#### Mood Detection Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All mood detection happens client-side only
- **No Cloud Transmission**: Mood data never leaves the user's device
- **Privacy Validation**: Automatic checks prevent mood data sharing
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to deletion and data portability

#### Social Learning Anonymization
- **Zero-Knowledge Aggregation**: Individual user data is never exposed
- **Differential Privacy**: Statistical noise added to prevent re-identification
- **PII Removal**: All personally identifiable information stripped
- **Hashed Identifiers**: Remaining IDs are cryptographically hashed

### 2. Intelligence Tier Security

#### Super Intelligent ML (Enterprise - Tier 1)
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Real-time anomaly detection in user behavior
- **Behavioral Anomaly Protection**: ML-based detection of suspicious patterns
- **Secure Model Storage**: Encrypted model weights and parameters
- **API Security**: Rotating keys, request signing, rate limiting

#### Adaptive Learning ML (Premium - Tier 2)
- **Secure Pattern Evolution**: Tamper-proof learning data storage
- **Model Integrity**: Cryptographic signatures on model updates
- **Learning Privacy**: User learning patterns encrypted at rest
- **Incremental Security**: Secure updates without full re-training

#### Cost-Optimized AI (Premium Fallback - Tier 3)
- **API Key Rotation**: Automatic 90-day key rotation
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and output filtering
- **Rate Limit Security**: Tier-based limits with anomaly detection
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking and alerts

#### Local ML (Base - Tier 4)
- **Client-Side Security**: All processing happens locally
- **Secure Fallback**: Encrypted local model storage
- **Offline Privacy**: No network transmission required
- **Model Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of local models
